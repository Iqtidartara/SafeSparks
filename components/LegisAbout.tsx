              Portable appliance testing is a major contributor to ensuring safety at all times, and will enable your business to comply with legal standards. Failure to implement a program of regular appliance testing can lead to serious consequences, as well as affecting insurance policies, as most insurance companies will assume that the owners of a business are compliant with all relevant regulations. These insurers are fully entitled to reduce, delay, or even refuse to pay on a claim for damage caused by a portable appliance that has not been PAT tested.
