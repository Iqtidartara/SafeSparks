    <h1 className="Faqh1">What is a Portable Appliance and what needs to be tested?</h1>
    <p className="Faqp">In simple terms any item that is connected to the electrical mains by a cable and plug is classified as a portable appliance, although the name suggests that the appliance should be &apos;portable&apos;, in reality any appliance that can be moved without unwiring is categorised as a portable appliance.<br/>
The regulations cover all items of in-service electrical equipment Items such as PC&apos;s, Monitors, Photocopiers, Fridges, Mobile phone charges, Fax machines, Computers, Music systems, Heaters, Irons, Drills, Kettles, Microwaves, Monitors, etc. In addition to being responsible for the safety of their own portable appliances, companies are also responsible for the safety of electrical equipment brought on site by employees and contractors.</p>
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col gap-[1.25rem] mt-[3.12rem]">
<h1 className="Faqh1">What does Testing involve?</h1>
<p className="Faqp">A visual inspection to check for damage and poor electrical standards followed by a series of instrument tests to check for less obvious electrical faults.<br/>
To enable testing to be carried out all electrical equipment has to be disconnected from the mains supply, we realise the inconvenience that this can cause, especially in a busy environment, and to minimise this, testing is carried out in its location. Microwaves also receive a free Leakage Test</p>
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col gap-[1.25rem] mt-[3.12rem]">
<h1 className="Faqh1">How often should I have testing done?</h1>
<p className="Faqp">The requirements are based on principles of risk assessment and reasonable practicability. The frequency of inspection and testing required will vary depending on the type of appliance, its location, and its use. This can range initially from 3 months to 48 months. However, more and more businesses and organisations are adopting a yearly PAT testing policy to further ensure the safety of users and make certain their legal responsibilities remain up to date, and this would always be our recommendation.</p>
