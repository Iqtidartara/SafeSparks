          “Every employer shall ensure that work equipment is so constructed or

          1998 cover most risks that can result from using work equipment, it
          should be noted that this includes but is not solely Electrical
          equipment. With respects to risks from electricity, compliance with
          the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 is likely to achieve
          compliance with PUWER regulations 5-9, 19 & 22.PUWER only applies to
          work equipment used by workers at work. This includes all work
          equipment (fixed, portable or transportable) connected to a source of
          electrical energy. PUWER does not apply to the fixed installations of
          the building, the safety of these is specifically dealt with in the
          Electricity at Work Regulations.
