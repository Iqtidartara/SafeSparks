        <p className="text-[#646464] text-[1.5rem] font-[500]  text-uppercase">Letting agents and private landlords could also be sued in Civil Law under the duty of care for failure to ensure the safety of tenants and as a result face similar punishment.</p>

        <p className="text-[#646464] text-[1.5rem] font-[500] text-uppercase">Insurance policies are also a concern. Most insurance companies will ask for evidence of PAT Testing before insuring you. Without the right documentation you may find yourself uninsured and liable for serious risk. PAT Dundee will supply you with all of the evidence you need to keep your records up-to-date for any third party who requires such information.</p>

        <p className="text-[#646464] text-[1.5rem] font-[500]  text-uppercase">In summary, the main purpose of PAT Testing is to provide ongoing safety for employees or tenants. You need to ensure your day to day environment complies with the legal standards and that appliances are safe and consistently tested on an ongoing basis.</p>
